Hi! We are working on the euclidean pattern for the strudel.cc kotlin port.

We have the pattern almost working perfectly. There is just on small flaw:

We now hear:

a . . a . . a . | a . . b . . b . | b .. c .. c . | c  . .CD .. d . | d .. d

While we should hear:

a . . a . . a . | a . . b . . b . | b .. c .. c . | c . . c .. d . | d .. d

So the first three bars are ok. But then it plays  c to d in short succession, while only d should be played. After this things are fine again.
This means somehow the one "d" is picked up to early.

I made some debug outputs:

```
Starting voice with note 'a' at frame 0
Starting voice with note 'a' at frame 36000
Starting voice with note 'a' at frame 72000
Starting voice with note 'a' at frame 96000
Starting voice with note 'b' at frame 132000
Starting voice with note 'b' at frame 168000
Starting voice with note 'b' at frame 192000
Starting voice with note 'c' at frame 228000
Starting voice with note 'c' at frame 264000
Starting voice with note 'c' at frame 288000
Starting voice with note 'c' at frame 324000
Starting voice with note 'd' at frame 329142
Starting voice with note 'd' at frame 360000
Starting voice with note 'd' at frame 384000
Starting voice with note 'd' at frame 420000
Starting voice with note 'e' at frame 456000
Starting voice with note 'e' at frame 480000
Starting voice with note 'e' at frame 516000
Starting voice with note 'f' at frame 552000
Starting voice with note 'f' at frame 576000
Starting voice with note 'f' at frame 612000
Starting voice with note 'f' at frame 648000
Starting voice with note 'g' at frame 658285
Starting voice with note 'g' at frame 672000
```

As we can see from the numbers ... something is off with this one "d" note ...
It seems to be the opposite problem. Is it picked up when it should not yet be picked up.
It comes too early i think.

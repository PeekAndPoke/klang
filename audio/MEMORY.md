# Klang Audio — Memory

## Current Status

- **JVM**: Full audio output via javax.sound.sampled ✅
- **JS**: Full audio output via Web Audio API + AudioWorklet ✅
- Synthesis: oscillators (sine/saw/square/triangle/supersaw/noise) + sample playback
- Effects: delay, reverb, phaser, compressor, ducking, distortion, bit-crush, tremolo

## Architecture Decisions

- **Block-based processing**: fixed-size blocks (128–256 frames). No per-sample allocation in hot paths.
- **Ring-buffer IPC**: `KlangCommLink` uses two `KlangRingBuffer`s — no locking between threads.
- **Voice pipeline**: `Voice` interface + `VoiceImpl` runs a **Pitch → Excite → Filter** pipeline.
  Filter stage is a composable `List<BlockRenderer>` built by `buildFilterPipeline()`.
  Pitch stage is still inline (pending extraction). Excite delegates to `Ignitor`.
- **Cylinders = effect buses**: up to 16 mixing channels, each with independent delay/reverb/phaser/compressor/ducking.
- **Master limiter**: −1 dB threshold, 20:1 ratio, 1 ms attack, 100 ms release — always last in chain.
- **`NullLiteral` / singletons**: `audio_bridge` data types use data classes; expect/actual for platform types.

## Numerical Safety Contract + Distort DC-Lock Fix (2026-04-27)

Established `SAFE_MIN = 1e-15f` / `SAFE_MAX = 1e15f` as the engine's numerical
safety bounds (matches SuperCollider/ChucK convention — see
`audio/ref/numerical-safety.md` for the reasoning and framework precedents).

Two helpers in `Ignitor.kt`: `safeDiv(d)` (sign-preserving magnitude clamp ≥ SAFE_MIN,
scrubs NaN) and `safeOut(v)` (output clamp to ±SAFE_MAX, scrubs NaN to 0).
Applied to divisor-class ops (`Div`, `Mod`, `Recip`) and output-clamp ops
(`Times`, `Pow`, `Exp`, `Sq`, `mul-by-const`).

Distort/clip path now applies the DC blocker **unconditionally** (was previously
only for `diode`/`rectify` shapes). Fixes user-reported rail-lock at extreme
drive amounts where output got stuck at -1 due to envelope-decay asymmetries.
Trade-off: transient overshoots up to ~2x at sharp transitions of square-like
signals — existing tests updated, master limiter handles the spike.

**Known gap (not fixed in this batch)**: the pitch-mod factories
(`vibratoModIgnitor`, `accelerateModIgnitor`, `pitchEnvelopeModIgnitor`, FM mod
in `PitchModFactories.kt`) all use unguarded `2.0.pow(...)` or `effectiveDepth /
freqHz` arithmetic that can overflow Float for extreme user inputs and poison
oscillator phase accumulators. Same kind of hazard the safety contract was
designed to catch — should be addressed in a follow-up.

## Ignitor Composable Architecture (2026-03-19)

New package `audio_be/.../ignitor/` — composable per-voice effect combinators.
Files: Ignitor, IgniteContext, ScratchBuffers, IgnitorEnvelopes, IgnitorFilters,
IgnitorEffects, IgnitorPitchMod, IgnitorFm. Phase 0+1 complete (additive, nothing wired in yet).

## Ignitor Param Slots — "Everything is a Signal" (2026-03-26)

All numeric ignitor parameters converted from `Double` to `IgnitorDsl` (Param slots).
`IgnitorDsl.Param(name, default, description)` is a new leaf node that produces a constant signal
by default, but can be replaced with any ignitor subtree for audio-rate modulation.

Key changes:

- **`ParamIgnitor`** runtime class fills buffer with constant value
- **`getParamSlots()`** walks DSL tree to discover all Param leaves (for generic UI)
- **Gain separated from oscillators**: factories produce raw output, gain applied via `withGain()`
- **`analog`** param: lazy `AnalogDrift` init on first block via `initAnalogDrift()`
- **Control-rate params** (filter cutoff, ADSR times, etc.): read once per block via `readParam()`
- **oscParams override**: `toIgnitor(oscParams)` propagates through tree; Param nodes check map by name
- **New DSL nodes**: Distort, Crush, Coarse, Phaser, Tremolo, Vibrato, Accelerate, PitchEnvelope
- **Convenience wrappers**: Double-accepting extension functions on IgnitorDsl still work

### Known Issues to Revisit

- ~~**Filter envelope release jumps from sustainLevel**~~ **FIXED (2026-03-23)**:
  `FilterModRenderer` now calculates the actual envelope level at gate end using
  `levelAtPosition()`, matching the amplitude ADSR's capture behavior.
- **`pitchEnvelope()` per-sample `pow()`**: `2.0.pow(amount * envLevel / 12.0)` called per sample.
  Expensive (~50-100ns per call). Could optimize sustain phase (constant value, compute once).
  `accelerate()` was already optimized to multiplicative stepping.
- **phaseMod save/restore lacks exception safety**: No try/finally wrapper around the
  save→set→generate→restore pattern in vibrato/accelerate/pitchEnvelope/fm combinators.
  Low risk (exceptions in audio hot paths are rare and fatal), but not structurally safe.
- **Stringly-typed distortion shape**: `distort(amount, shape = "soft")` uses String for shape
  selection. Typos silently fall through to default. Consider enum in the future.

## BlockRenderer Pipeline Architecture (2026-03-23)

Voice rendering refactored into **Pitch → Excite → Filter** pipeline using composable `BlockRenderer` stages.

Key files:

- `voices/strip/BlockRenderer.kt` — `fun interface BlockRenderer { fun render(ctx: BlockContext) }`
- `voices/strip/BlockContext.kt` — shared context (buffers, timing, ignitor)
- `voices/strip/EnvelopeCalc.kt` — shared control-rate envelope calculation
- `voices/strip/pitch/` — VibratoRenderer, AccelerateRenderer, PitchEnvelopeRenderer, FmRenderer
- `voices/strip/excite/IgniteRenderer.kt` — wraps Ignitor as BlockRenderer
- `voices/strip/filter/` — FilterModRenderer, AudioFilterRenderer, EnvelopeRenderer, FilterPipelineBuilder

Status: **Complete.** `Voice` (merged from Voice interface + VoiceImpl) runs a `List<BlockRenderer>` pipeline:
Pitch renderers → IgniteRenderer → Filter renderers → SendRenderer.
Bus pipeline: composable `KatalystEffect` pipeline (`cylinders/bus/`).
`VoiceScheduler` split into `VoiceScheduler` (scheduling) + `VoiceFactory` (voice construction).
Legacy effect filters (BitCrush, SampleRateReducer, Distortion, Tremolo, Phaser) replaced by
BlockRenderer implementations. ~426 tests across 35 files.
See `docs/agent-tasks/audio-pipeline-open-topics.md` for remaining open topics.

## Lessons Learned

- `KlangTime.internalMsNow()` is monotonic, NOT wall-clock — use only for relative timing.
- JS target requires ES2015 classes for AudioWorkletProcessor inheritance (KMP default is ES5 — override needed).
- `MonoSamplePcm` is always mono; stereo is handled at the `Cylinders` pan/mix level.
- `FilterDefs.addOrReplace()` is additive — calling it twice with the same filter type replaces, not duplicates.
- `VoiceData` fields are nullable with defaults — omitting a field means "use engine default".
- `duckCylinder` in `VoiceData` sets the cylinder ID to duck when a voice plays; ducking is cross-cylinder sidechain.
